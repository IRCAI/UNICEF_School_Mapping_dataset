- Inside /dataset there should be a folder called 'all', inside 'all' folder are the 'school' and 'not_school' folders
- Populate the /dataset/all/school with image tiles in the school folder provided 
- Populate the /dataset/all/not_school with image tiles in the not_school folder provided 
- Then run the training/school_classifier_training.py script: set base_path variable to Path("../datasets") and shuffle_all_images to True
- - At the end you will have three new folders (train, test and validation folders)inside datasets with different number of images on each
- You will end with this file structure in the dataset folder
- /datasets/all/school
- /datasets/all/no_school
- /datasets/train/school
- /datasets/train/no_school
- /datasets/test/school
- /datasets/test/no_school
- /datasets/validation/school
- /datasets/validation/no_school
